# Media

Media items are digital assets—images, videos or files (PDFs, docs)—that you can upload once and then reuse throughout your store.

### Why Use Media?

* **Visual Engagement**\
  Enrich pages and blocks with images or videos to capture customer attention.
* **Reusability**\
  Upload a media item once and reference it in any collection, block or page.
* **Organization**\
  Assign media to Collections or use tags/translations to keep assets easy to find.

3. **Fill in**:
   * **Code** (unique identifier)
   * **Upload** your file (image, video or document)
4. **Save** the media item.
5. **Add it**, for example, to one of your previously created page configurations to see your media live.
6. **Repeat** to add more assets as needed.
