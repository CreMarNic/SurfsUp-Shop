# Blocks

**Blocks** are modular content containers you build from content elements (text, images, product grids, etc.) and place anywhere on your site—product pages, landing pages, footers—to deliver targeted, contextual content.

#### Why Use Blocks?

* **Contextual Placement**\
  Show promotions, product highlights or informational snippets exactly where they matter.
* **Reusability**\
  Create a block once and display it on multiple pages or for different products/taxons.
* **Flexibility**\
  Combine any mix of content elements to craft custom layouts without coding.

#### Creating a Block

1. **Open Admin** → go to **CMS → Blocks**
2. **Click** “Create New Block”
3. **Fill in**:
   * **Code** (unique identifier)
   * **Name** (admin label)
4. **Save** the block
5. **Refresh** your storefront to see it live
6. **Repeat** to add more blocks as needed.

#### Optional Configuration

* **Display on Specific Products**\
  Choose individual products so the block appears only on their product pages.
* **Display for Products in a Taxon**\
  Select a taxon (uses “Main Taxon”) to show the block on all product pages within that category.
* **Display on Taxon Pages**\
  Pick taxonomies so the block renders on those category (taxon) listing pages.
