Contributing Translations
=========================

The Sylius application is fully translatable, and its extensive language support is made possible by contributions from our community.

How to contribute translations in any language?
-----------------------------------------------

You can contribute translations to Sylius by opening a Pull Request on GitHub. There are two ways to do this:

- **by the GitHub web interface** (easier)

- **by using Git locally** (recommended for larger contributions)

Contributing by the GitHub web interface
-----------------------------------------

1. **Go to the Sylius repository**: visit the `Sylius GitHub repository <https://github.com/Sylius/Sylius>`_.
2. **Find the translation files**: navigate to ``src/Sylius/Bundle/[YourBundle]/Resources/translations/``.
3. **Edit the file**: click on the file for your language and then on the edit button.
4. **Make your changes**: add or update the translations as needed.
5. **Propose the change**: click **Commit changes...**, provide a commit message, and select **"Create a new branch and start a pull request"**.
6. **Submit the Pull Request**: click **Propose changes**, then **Create pull request**.

Contributing by Git locally
----------------------------

1. Follow :doc:`the guide for submitting a patch </book/contributing/code/patches>`.
2. Add or update translations by editing the files inside ``src/Sylius/Bundle/YourBundle/Resources/translations/``.

Once your pull request is reviewed and approved, your translations will be merged.

That's all! You can start translating.
